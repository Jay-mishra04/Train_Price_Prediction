Price Prediction Model
Overview
This project involves building a price prediction model using historical data to forecast future prices. The model is designed to help users make informed decisions by predicting prices based on various features.

Key Components
Data Collection: The project starts with gathering historical price data. This data is crucial for training the model and making accurate predictions.

Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it's suitable for training. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.

Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms are applied to the preprocessed data to train the prediction model. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared. This helps in understanding the accuracy of predictions.

Pipeline: A pipeline is used to automate the process of data preprocessing, model training, and prediction. This ensures that the entire process is streamlined and reproducible.

Flask API: A Flask application is implemented to provide an easy-to-use interface for making predictions. Users can interact with the model through a web API.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/price-prediction-model.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd price-prediction-model

Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Running the Flask Application: Start the Flask application to make predictions: python app.py

Making Predictions: Use the API endpoint to get price predictions. For example, send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/predict with the relevant input data.

Example request using curl: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"feature1": value1, "feature2": value2}' http://localhost:5000/predict

Interpreting Results: The API will return a JSON response with the predicted price and any relevant details.
